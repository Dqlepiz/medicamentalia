In the USA, it’s known as the $1,000 pill. And that’s not a metaphor. Each pill of sofosbuvir, the new drug for the treatment of Hepatitis C, costs exactly that. The medicine, sold by Gilead under the name Sovaldi, has again sparked discussion on the patent system and how it affects access to medicines and **the sustainability of health budgets** in countries of all income levels, especially developing ones. In September 2014, the company decided to bypass the traditional model in India, granting seven local pharmaceutical companies a voluntary license. These companies are permitted to develop and produce Sofosbuvir **in exchange for 7% of the final profit**. The [agreement](http://gilead.com/~/media/Files/pdfs/other/HCVGenericAgreementFactSheet.pdf) comes with small print; these laboratories can export their low cost version to 91 countries listed in the conditions (15 of which are small island states). According to Gilead’s estimates, this means that the cheaper treatment produced in India will reach 100 million people. Of course, the rest of the world is left out.

Hence, in European countries like Spain, it costs [€7.862](http://www.contratacion.euskadi.eus/w32-1084/es/contenidos/anuncio_contratacion/exposakidetza22363/es_doc/adjuntos/resolucion_definitiva1.pdf?rand=50165) to buy a box of 28 tablets, which equates to €23,587 for the basic three-month treatment. In France, the same prescription [climbs](http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/france_agrees_lowest_sovaldi_pricing_in_eu_618661) to a cost of to €41,000 (13,667 per box). Although there is a considerable reduction in price in America (of €75,000 per treatment*), the figures are so high that, as NGO Médicos del Mundo warns, "[they] are unaffordable for healthcare systems". So many patients that could benefit from the treatment do not have access to it. As a consequence, the NGO [appealed against Gilead](http://www.medicosdelmundo.org/index.php/mod.conts/mem.detalle_cn/relmenu.111/id.4220) before the European Patent Office in February. While admitting the treatment "is an important therapeutic advance," they argue in their appeal that "the molecule itself is not new enough to justify a patent."

And it is not just a first world problem. Countries like Brazil, China, Mexico, Turkey, Thailand, Ukraine and Morocco **have been banned from the list** of possible recipients of the Indian Sofosbuvir generic. Thai civil society [estimated](http://www.hepcoalition.org/IMG/pdf/thai_cso_s_statement_on_sof_vl_final.pdf) that treating all the patients in the country would require $121,000 million (€108,000 million), while their health budget in 2014 was $8,400 million (€7,500 million). In Brazil, where the drug was approved by the national drug agency ANVISA last March, the government is still negotiating with Gilead. Brazilian organizations have already criticized their exclusion from the Indian agreement, [estimating](http://abiaids.org.br/brasil-e-excluido-de-licenca-que-autoriza-producao-de-genericos-para-remedio-contra-hepatite-c/27134) that the final price of the 3-month basic treatment will cost around $7,000 (€6,200). In total, [46%](http://www.hepcoalition.org/actua/herramientas-de-incidencia/article/la-licencia-de-gilead-sobre-los?lang=en) **of global Hepatitis C patients are outside** the agreement between Gilead and the Indian laboratories; each of their countries will have to negotiate the price paid for Sovaldi.

Months after the voluntary license agreement was signed in January, India, once more, became the protagonist in the controversy around the new treatment for Hepatitis C. The country's courts [accepted](http://www.msf.es/noticia/2015/india-rechaza-patente-del-sofosbuvir-para-tratamiento-hepatitis-c) an appeal of civil organizations and rejected the patent. Can they now export the generic everywhere? No, because by signing a voluntary license the laboratories have already committed to veto certain countries from its commercialization. Moreover, in most regions of the world, the Sovaldi patent is already approved, or in the process of being; closing the door to the entry of generics.
