## The team

Medicamentalia Vaccines is a journalistic investigation by [Civio](http://www.civio.es/){:target="_blank"} into the current situation of vaccination worldwide, combining data analysis with field research in a range of countries. This is the sequel to our first investigation, focused on [access to medicines](/access/), which was awarded Investigation of the Year (small newsroom) in the Data Journalism Awards and the Gabriel García Márquez Journalism Prize (Innovation category). 

This second investigation, like the first, has benefited from a grant from [Journalism Grants](https://journalismgrants.org/){:target="_blank"}, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which also funds big projects related to vaccination, such as GAVI. Neither Journalism Grants nor the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation influenced the project or its journalistic investigation. In fact, like all the other readers, they did not have access to its contents until it was published.

Medicamentalia is the work of the members of Civio in conjunction with an array of valued collaborators, in a range of fields, from a variety of countries. We are pleased to introduce you to the team.

### Acknowledgements
This project would not have been possible without the initial grant from **Journalism Grants**. We would like to thank the [European Journalism Center](http://ejc.net/){:target="_blank"} for sponsoring this research, as they did for the first part of the Medicamentalia project, and their infinite patience and understanding with the problems that delayed the launch; especially to **Diana Lungu** who was always ready to lend a hand. 

Our *media partners* also gave the green light to this project before it became a reality. Thanks to [Correctiv](https://correctiv.org/en/){:target="_blank"}, [El Mundo](http://www.elmundo.es/){:target="_blank"}, [Euronews](http://www.euronews.com/){:target="_blank"}, [La Sexta](http://www.lasexta.com/){:target="_blank"}, [The Bureau of Investigative Journalism](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Il Sole](http://www.ilsole24ore.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Euro Scientist](http://www.euroscientist.com/){:target="_blank"} for their faith and support. Without them, we would reach a far smaller audience and much of this work would have been in vain. **Hugo Garrido**, **Verónica Ramírez** and **Hristio Boytchev** helped us to adapt the contents to their media. 

To examine a subject as complex as immunization in greater depth, we needed to get seriously involved in the topic. We read dozens of scientific *papers* and hundreds of existing articles on the subject. Many of them are referenced in the study. Thanks to all the researchers and specialist journalists that led the way for us, such as Javi Salas, from El País, author of numerous articles on the subject. Thanks also to the friends that helped us along the way, such as Ximena Villagrán in Guatemala.

Thanks to everyone that gave up their time and knowledge in the interviews, both those in the preliminary research and those that appear in the reports, for their generosity. During the process, we received important awards that gave us a powerful boost. We would like to thank the juries and the teams at the Data Journalism Awards and the Gabriel García Márquez Journalism Prize for this recognition.

## Methodology

{: #preliminary-research}
### Preliminary research

As with all Civio projects, the first step forwards in the investigation implied a necessary step backwards - we had to take a plunge unto the subject. Whilst in the first part of the Medicamentalia project we focused on researching access to medicines (prices, patent systems, etc.), in this second phase we wanted to investigate vaccines on an international level. This time, we wanted to go beyond the costs and focus on other elements such as immunization rates, the problems that exist with immunization, how pooled purchasing systems operate between different countries and supply issues, to name but a few. 

We read dozens of academic articles and thoroughly analysed documents from international organisations, as well as recent reports from the [Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE)](http://www.who.int/immunization/policy/sage/en/){:target="_blank"}, a WHO group that analyses themes related to immunization. 

We were not the first to investigate such a topic and *we were inspired by the research of our peers*. The [analysis and visualisation](http://graphics.wsj.com/infectious-diseases-and-vaccines/){:target="_blank"} of the effects of the introduction of the measles vaccine in various US states, created by the Wall Street Journal is of particular note. It made us consider the possibility of creating a similar graphic on a wider scale, to cover all the countries in the world (or most of them, anyway). So, we created the graphic that you can see in the report on immunization levels. We were also inspired by the [study](http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2016/03/daily-chart-16?utm_content=31884172&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter){:target="_blank"} by The Economist about the surprising differences in immunization rates between developing countries and developed countries. This is a theme that caught our attention when we first studied the data and is reflected in the article about anti-vaccine sentiment. 

{: #the-data}
### The data
For this research, we needed to cross check various databases: immunization rates, cases by disease, deaths by disease, immunization schedules, levels of *stockouts*, public budgets allocated to immunization campaigns, purchase prices of vaccines for countries and organisations, as well as the basic elements required to provide context such as GDP or population by country or region. The majority of data collected, although updated in December 2016, refers to information covering the period up to 2015.

We found some of the data in easily reusable databases, although it required some cleansing. Other information was obtained from websites where it required *scraping* to obtain a version of the data that we could work with. In more complicated instances, we had to draw upon a range of several data sources. 

#### Which vaccines did we analyse?
We began by considering the WHO [list of essential medicines](http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/en/){:target="_blank"}. We studied the advice and immunization schedules for each one, in an attempt to cover the most common diseases worldwide, which would allow us to make comparisons between different countries. 

We created a document for each vaccine to link them to the disease and better understand how they work (doses, advice, etc.) We had to exclude from some analysis the relationship between vaccines and diseases which have more than one origin, as is the case with meningitis (which has various vaccines depending on the type of the disease), for example. Although there is a long list, according to the analysis of the results we included particular vaccines in the research. This does not mean that the others are less important, we simply found less relevant information about them or only information that was not comparable. 

**This data is not perfect**, however it was sufficiently meaningful for us to be able to extract conclusions. In fact, [one of the concerns](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/251810/1/WER9148.pdf?ua=1){:target="_blank"} of the group of vaccine experts at the WHO is the poor data quality. “How can you conduct an investigation without all objective information available on the subject?” Immunization data is not collected from certain countries. Moreover, some of the figures gathered by the WHO and other statistical services do not concur. An example of this problem is the statistics of cases of each disease from the WHO and those from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), which do not entirely concur. 

#### Immunization data
This is used in a great deal of our research and shows the percentage of people that have received a vaccine out of the number of people that should receive it. Data runs from as far back as 1980 for some diseases, to 2015. The [source](http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/data/Coverage_survey_data.xls?ua=1){:target="_blank"} is the WHO. We also reviewed the WHO [interactive immunization atlas](http://gamapserver.who.int/gho/interactive_charts/immunization/polio/atlas.html){:target="_blank"}, but this does not relate immunization rates with GDP and other variables - just the geographical location.

Although this is fairly complete data and very useful for our research, we must take into account the fact that these are **estimates**. 

*What is the methodology of the WHO?*. Over [95% of countries provide annual estimates](http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/87/7/08-053819.pdf?ua=1#page=3){:target="_blank"} of their immunization rates to the World Health Organization (WHO), which subsequently revises the data. The WHO anticipate that these estimates have a [margin of error of ± 3%](http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/87/7/08-053819.pdf?ua=1#page=5){:target="_blank"} which may reach up to ± 20%.

Countries themselves have two methods to establish immunization rates of their population.

- By administration - vaccination rates are obtained by dividing the number of vaccines administered (the numerator) by the target population (the denominator). This is the most common. This method can produce errors if there are flaws in the data, for instance with the total population figure or in cases of high domestic mobility. Source: [WHO](http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/routine/coverage/en/index1.html#){:target="_blank"} , [PAHO](http://www.paho.org/immunization/toolkit/resources/reporting-monitoring/es/Modulo2-coberturas-administrativas.pdf?ua=1#page=19){:target="_blank"}, [Ministry of Health](http://www.msssi.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/prevPromocion/vacunaciones/coberturas.htm){:target="_blank"}.

For example, to calculate the immunization coverage in children aged between 12 to 23 months, the number of children aged between 12 and 23 months that have received all the doses that they were due, according to the immunization schedule of that country, is divided by the total number of children aged between 12 and 23 months in that country.

- By surveys - which should be carried out every 3 to 5 years. These are useful to study the reliability of the administration method, [or to substitute it](http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/Vaccination_coverage_cluster_survey_with_annexes.pdf?ua=1#page=12){:target="_blank"}. Data is obtained from immunization records and the vaccination history of medical centres or interviews with families. The calculation of the numerators and denominators is similar to that of the administration method, but in smaller groups. Source: [WHO](http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/routine/coverage/en/index2.html){:target="_blank"}.

In both cases, we had to consider how to handle the issue of multiple dose vaccines. Sometimes it was interesting to compare the results between the first and the last dose, but for certain research we decided which dose was the most representative. In principle, for the majority of the analysis we used the final dose, on the basis that having reached this stage implies having received the full course of immunization required to be effective. In our analysis to test our stance, we found very few anomalies in which the immunization percentage of the last dose is greater than that of previous doses.

There are a few specific exceptions. For instance, for the second dose of the measles vaccine, France only submitted data for the period up to 2014. For our analysis, in the same way as the WHO does in their [country factsheets](http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/data/fra.pdf){:target="_blank"}, we prolong the 2014 figure into 2015, until the final data, which will be published over the course of 2017, becomes available.

For **herd immunization** we have used a rate of 95% for measles (the figure which is agreed in most research). For the DPT vaccine line we used 80%, the minimum coverage level recommended by the WHO SAGE group. According to calculations of the necessary rate to achieve herd immunization, polio would require between 80% and 86%. We used 80%, the lowest rate within this range. Two sources ([here](http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/2/07-040089/en/) and [here](http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/52/7/911.full){:target="_blank"}) discuss the subject, although there are many more.

#### Cases and deaths by disease
In order to determine the number of cases of each disease recorded every year, we used the WHO [table of incidences](http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/data/en/){:target="_blank"}, to which we have added certain data:

- In order to be able to include cases of polio in 2016 in the successes article video, we used the information available in [Polio Eradication](http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/){:target="_blank"}, an extremely up to date report on the global state of polio. The dots are ubicated by country, but inside a country they are randomly distributed.  
- For the video about Guatemala, we added the information from recent months taken from the [survey](http://fundesa.org.gt/content/files/publicaciones/SegundoSondeoVacunacion.pdf){:target="_blank"} carried out by the Guatemalan Human Rights Council, Action Against Hunger, ALIANMISAR (National Alliance for Indigenous Women's Organisations for Reproductive Health, Nutrition and Education) and the Alliance for Nutrition.
- We reviewed a complementary source for measles data from the [WHO’s monthly reports](http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/burden/vpd/surveillance_type/active/measles_monthlydata/en/){:target="_blank"}. However, since some countries send the data late and with different timing, we only used the monthly data to be aware of the most recent trends, and didn't rely on it for the final content.

As is the case with vaccination coverage, the data on numbers of cases [is not perfect](http://apps.who.int/gho/indicatorregistry/App_Main/view_indicator.aspx?iid=57){:target="_blank"}. Taking into account the fact that the data only includes cases which are treated under the healthcare systems and are therefore officially recorded, the conclusion is clear: **more cases occur than those which appear in the data**. As the WHO explain: “Many countries face challenges in accurately identifying, diagnosing and reporting infectious diseases due to the remoteness of communities, lack of transport and communication infrastructure, and a shortage of skilled health-care workers and laboratory facilities to ensure accurate diagnosis.” 

An indication that data is not 100% exact is the lack of agreement with other databases. For example, to gather the information from European countries there is also the [ECDC](http://atlas.ecdc.europa.eu/public/index.aspx?Instance=GeneralAtlas){:target="_blank"} (their methodology, [here](http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/activities/surveillance/Pages/index.aspx#sthash.Y3Namw3l.dpuf){:target="_blank"}). We carried out various tests to ascertain that the data did not concur (although by only a small margin of error) and this demonstrates the need for a clear and consolidated system of data collection. The ECDC data is more recent and was useful to contextualise the data, however we did not include this in our database because it only covers certain diseases and its scope is limited to Europe.

We excluded countries with very little data from the analysis and presentations.

We have also used mortality figures, from two sources: 

- Child mortality by country and [by disease](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.ghe100-AGO?lang=en){:target="_blank"}. With data from 2000 to 2015.
- General mortality data by disease, [here](http://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-compare/){:target="_blank"}.

#### Other data sources

- Immunization schedules for all countries via [WHO](http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/schedules){:target="_blank"}.
- The years of vaccine introductions. In some cases, the dates of introduction were very recent and did not match the information from the countries. Moreover, 28 countries did not have the information. We requested this information from eight countries and only one responded - Guatemala. 
- GDP data is taken from the World Bank, as is population data. This enabled us to calculate the number of cases per capita and, in some cases, omit certain countries from the charts in order to simplify the visualizations: concretely, we omitted data from countries with a population of less than 300,000 from the graph that compares different immunization rates. 

{: #reports-and-website}
### Reports and website

Analysis of all this information allowed us to draw some very interesting conclusions, but we needed to examine it in even more detail. We were clear from the start that we needed first-hand reports. We focused the research on two regions and prepared the interviews. We chose two destinations: 

- **Central America**. The aim was to analyse what had happened in Guatemala, which had suffered a significant drop in immunization coverage for basic vaccines, and analyse the situation in Guatemala and El Salvador with regards to the Human Papilloma vaccine, as this was not included in the vaccination schedules but cervical cancer rates in these countries are sky-high. We also wanted to talk to the people in charge of pooled purchasing systems such as the PAHO revolving fund and the COMISCA group to understand how these work. 
- **South Africa**. Although the initial idea was to go to India, various problems with the embassy delayed and finally prevented the trip. We needed a plan B and we chose South Africa because we were very interested to see how the vaccination system worked in a country that did not receive external aid and had suffered important problems of *stockouts*.

We combined the data analysis, the reporting and the stories that we were told on this trip into this website, in English and Spanish, which is developed with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}, and uses Javascript and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/){:target="_blank"} for the data visualizations. You can find the code of the web in our [Github repository](https://github.com/civio/medicamentalia){:target="_blank"}.
Journalism Grants offered their support throughout the project, but this in no way influenced any editorial decisions.

Most of the data visualizations are **customized, displaying information depending on the country from which the reader is connected**. This is the case for the three visualizations on measles, DTP and polio immunization levels in the article about [vaccination](/vaccines/immunization/), and in the two charts (on measles vaccination and vaccine mistrust) in the article about the [anti-vaccine movement](/vaccines/antivacunas).
